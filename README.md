# REACT Currency Converter

## What is this project about?

This Currency Converter project offers users the opportunity to convert from one currency to the other.
This project is built with [React](https://react.dev) JS library and the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) bundler, using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styles.

## Contributions

1. Refactored the code for optimization such as:
   1. Built a custom hook `useCurrencyInfo` to handle currency information.
   1. used the `useMemo` hook to memoize the <b>formattedClassName</b> and <b>currencyOptionsList</b>, thus preventing unnecessary re-renders when their dependencies stayed the same.
   1. Used the `useState` hook to manage the <b>amount</b> state locally for better performance and control.
   1. Combined <b>input</b> value handling and `onAmountChange` within `handleAmountChange` for a more concise approach.
   1. Used a ternary operator to display an empty string for `amount` when it equalled zero, thus streamlining conditional rendering.
   1. Checked for the existence of `onAmountChange` and `onCurrencyChange` before invoking them thereby preventing potential errors had those functions not existed.
   1. Added <b>error handling mechanism</b> to gracefully handle errors and give some user feedback.
2. Added the "Reset" button so that the user doesn't have to use the browser's refresh button
3. Improved CSS for more UX ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
